### Why be rich

We want to be rich, it's not a choice, but a necessity.
**We need money** for - 

1. To eat better
2. To wear better clothes
3. For heat in summer, we need ac
4. To use AC we need eletricity
5. Human comfort is measured in money

### Office ettiquets that you should follow

1. Don't look for approval or promotion
2. Don't try to impress
3. Don't stick to the place just because you think it is like home.
4. Apply elsewhere if you can get better opportunity.
5. You are just a replacement.
6. Stop emotional attachment to workplace, so that leaving is easy.

If you earn 25K, extend your work for that amount,
use the rest of your efficiency on yourself.

### Smartwork over hardwork

Bosses are smart, they keep employee engaged,
no one gives a shit about you, this is corporate world.
They use you, so -

1. If JOB requires 10%, do 10%.
2. Spend your **90% on yourself**.
3. Do the amount of work you are getting paid for.
4. Improve yourself when you get time.
5. Don't be lazy. **Evolve** Constantly.
6. Three types of people - 
    1. First have no clue what they are doing
    2. Second are happy with what they have
    3. Third are happy being followers

These people aren't dreamers. they are workforces.

You, **work for yourself**.

If you are not getting rewarded, screw the job in your mind.
Do the minimum.
Get your increment at the end of the year and **get the fuck out of there**.

### Give your **100%**

If you want to live mediocre, ordinay, never truly acheive what you want,
stay the same.

People surrounding you are not giving their 100% either, use it as advantage.

100% does not mean tedious labour.
You have a natural potential, energy, daily capacity, efficiency.
You have a choice to fulfil and use 100% of that potential every single day.

#### What do losers do?
They don't give a shit.
"*I don't even plan for the next hour. How silly of you to ask me of tomorrow.*"
This is mostly said with a pride by them.

#### What do winners do?
They consciously plan and choose the activity in which they will spend there
potential energy.

They have their shit planned in a tight schedule.

1. Figure your daily routine out on a piece of paper,
where will you be spending that potential.

### Things to avoid

**90%** of your efficiency goes in the following, mental if not for physical -

- Girls
- Texting
- Porn
- Movies
- Games
- TV Shows
- More Texting
- Gaming apps
- Internet
- Youtube
- Facebook
- Instagram
- Snapchat
- Get Togethers
- Clubbing
- Partying
- Malls
- Planned Dinners
- Hangouts
- Drinking
- Smoking
- Drugs

Using this for entertainment, gossip and timepass, you feed your mind
information it does not need aimlessly, mind isn't sentient, it will
consume all this information and your **mind will get too tired for studies, work,
learning, brainstorming, creative thinking or any other productive engagement**.

When you watch a movie at theatre, you talk and think about it the entire day.
Although it was just for entertainment, but you fed that information to your mind
with greatest focus for 2 to 3 hours.

Gaming 7 to 8 hours a day makes you dream about it too.
Because it has taken your constant focus, but this time is 7 to 8 hours, 
this kind of exposure to some information makes it take over mind even on subconscious level.

Don't just stop watching movies and TV shows.

**Prioritize** Introduce this word in your life.

All this entertainment is not for your entertainment, but to make tonnes of money
from people like you. They are not helping you but fulfilling their selfish motives.  
Why are you helping them endlessly then?

### What to do

1. Figure out your potential waste of energy and make change.
2. Avoid 10% work and 90% wasting time, girls and shit.
3. Do 90% work and 10% fun.
4. Work for yourself and on yourself.

Most people want to better themselves. But the get satified just by the answer.
As the solution is asking them to work.  

Success demands - 

1. exercises
2. efforts

What we want -

1. Magical solutions
2. Little formulas
3. Exercises that fixes our problem in seconds

### Why 100% is important

1. World is simple, opportunities exists that will increase
the state of your bank account.  
2. To get those opportunities, you need the be prepared.
3. Preparations are not overnight, which is what you are used to of,
thus remaining in the stupid workforce.

Most people stop doing 90% of their bullshit, but then waste time
in the vacuum they have created, as the work the do still remains 10%.

You can get rid of the apps, girls and other addictions, but it is still useless
if you do not know how to utilize the newly saved time.

You do know what you have to do inorder to grow, succeed and crush everyone else.

**Be patient**

### Manage

manage your addictions. Don't get rid of them, learn to control them first.
 
Acknowledgement of your problems is the first step to recovery. 

You're close to your victory.

### What to do

Take some time out, find out, acknowledge, and accept all the things you do
on daily basis that takes lots of your time and give nothing in return.

Just do it.

It is a re-evolution.

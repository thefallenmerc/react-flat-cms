### Why?

- You waste way more time on girls
- Think of all the girls you have texted with? How much time in vain!
- Just because she is free doesn't mean she is going to be your gf.
- You are not only guy texting her
- You are ready to do anything for her, 
- You get to meet only IDIOT GIRLS, because smart ones are the ones you wont meet as you are royally fucking up your life.
They dont waste their time texting random people
- You cant understand a girl because she too des not know what she is doing.
- She is just living in the moment, that is a very dangerous person to pin your hopes on.
- Because she will take away your focus, years, oppurtunities and happiness.
- She makes self serving choice that fascinates her the most in that moment.
- If you care about yourself, value yourself, have goals in your life and respect yourself,
you will find a girl who loves you for who you are and will be independent.
- To meet such people who have have also elevated themself from this shit hole,
you will have to detach yourself from the life you are dissatisfied with right now.
- Stop making compromises, make sacrifices
- If you are already in a relationship, but are unhappy, your state of mind is affected by it.
You are unable to focus, dealing with her takes all your time, Then there are two options

  1. Your life
  2. A heck load of amount of time before she dumps your ass.

- If your relationship isnt going well, it will end, because she is not enjoying it either, but you are 
are bent upon following that compromising mindset, and dragging yourself with that relationship.
- Get out of a relationship that is stopping you from giving your 100%.
